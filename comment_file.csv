Jo rakhe hain tune kadam
Tere naam pe meri zindagi
Likh di mere humdum
 
Haan seekha maine jeena jeena kaise jeena
Haan seekha maine jeena mere humdum
Na seekha kabhi jeena jeena kaise jeena
Na seekha jeena tere bina humdum

Jo rakhe hain tune kadam
Tere naam pe meri zindagi
Likh di mere humdum
 
Sacchi si hain yeh taareefein
Dil se jo maine kari hain…
 
Sacchi si hain yeh taareefein
Dil se jo maine kari hain…
 
Jo tu mila to saji hain
Duniya meri humdum
O aasma mila zameen ko meri
Aadhe aadhe poore hain hum
Tere naam pe meri zindagi
Likh di mere humdum
 
Haan seekha maine jeena jeena, kaise jeena
Haan seekha maine jeena, mere humdum
Na seekha kabhi jeena jeena kaise jeena
Na seekha jeena tere bina humdum"
